# Shark Attack

## What is it?

Shark attack is a simple 1 vs 1 game where two players play against each other, firing lasers and avoiding getting hit by one. 

## Installation

This project requires the python interpreter to be installed. The only extra dependencies are the ones needed by the pygame library, which can be installed with the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Once this is done, the game can be run by executing the following command from the game folder:

```bash
python3 game.py
```



## Playing

Player 1 can move its character with the "w", "a", "s" and "d" keys and fire lasers with the "c" key, while player 2 can move its character with the arrow keys and shoot pressing the space bar. The first one to get hit loses.



Enjoy!
